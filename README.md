# Applied Data Science Capstone: Predictive Analysis and Visualization of SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Outcomes  

## Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Applied Data Science Capstone assignment**.  
The chosen topic is **Applied Data Science Capstone: Predictive Analysis and Visualization of SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Outcomes**, which focuses on analyzing historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data, creating visualizations, and applying machine learning models to predict future launch success.  

## Steps Followed  
1. Collected SpaceX launch data using APIs and web scraping.  
2. Cleaned and prepared the datasets for analysis.  
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL and visualization tools.  
4. Built interactive maps and dashboards for visual analytics.  
5. Applied machine learning models to predict Falcon 9 launch success.  
6. Compiled results and summarized findings in a presentation.
